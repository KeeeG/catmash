# catmash
Basic voting system for the cutest cat

The purpose of this exercise is to develop a mini web application that allows you to find the cutest cat.

Based on the Facemash UX and data from https://latelier.co/data/cats.json.

The application should therefore be composed of two pages:
- A page to vote.
- A page to see all the cats with their score.
No requirement on technical choices.
The application must be able to be used from Google Chrome.
The project must be published on a public GitHub repository.
The project must be hosted to be publicly accessible.


Technical environment of the project:

Backend (Lambda) langage: 
- Node.js 12.X
Database:
- Aurora (AWS)
